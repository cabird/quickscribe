    prompt: |
        I have a transcript labeled with generic speaker tags ("Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.). Based on 
        conversation context, including tone, phrasing, and topics discussed, please infer suitable 
        names or labels for each speaker.

        - If an actual name cannot be determined, assign a unique label for each speaker that reflects 
        their role or personality based on the conversation (e.g., "Mentor" or "Organizer").
        - Ensure each inferred name or label is **unique and concise** (preferably one word, max two) 
        and does not overlap with other labels.
        - Clearly explain your reasoning for each choice in a concise manner.

        Please output in the following format:

        *** Reasoning ***

        <Provide reasoning for the inferred names/roles of each speaker here>

        *** JSON ***

        {
          "Speaker 1": { "name": "<inferred name or label>", "reasoning": "<concise reasoning>" },
          "Speaker 2": { "name": "<inferred name or label>", "reasoning": "<concise reasoning>" },
          "Speaker 3": { "name": "<inferred name or label>", "reasoning": "<concise reasoning>" }
        }
