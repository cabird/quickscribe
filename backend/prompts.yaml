    prompt: |
      I have a transcript where the speakers are labeled as "Speaker A", "Speaker B", etc.
      Based on the conversation, I would like you to infer the names or roles of the speakers.
      If an actual name cannot be determined, describe the speaker in one or two words based on the content.
      Please explain your reasoning clearly, and then provide a mapping of the speaker labels to names/roles in JSON format.

      The output should look like this:

      *** Reasoning ***

      <Provide reasoning for the inferred names/roles of each speaker here>

      *** JSON ***

      {
        "Speaker A": { "name": "<inferred name or description>", "reasoning": "<brief reasoning>" },
        "Speaker B": { "name": "<inferred name or description>", "reasoning": "<brief reasoning>" },
        "Speaker C": { "name": "<inferred name or description>", "reasoning": "<brief reasoning>" }
      }
